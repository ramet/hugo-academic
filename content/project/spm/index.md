# SPM: SParse Matrix package

[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.inria.fr/solverstack/spm/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.inria.fr/solverstack/spm/pipelines) [![coverage report](https://gitlab.inria.fr/solverstack/spm/badges/master/coverage.svg)](https://sonarqube.inria.fr/sonarqube/dashboard?id=hiepacs%3Aspm%3Agitlab%3Amaster)[![coverity report](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/20444/badge.svg)](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/spm)

SPM (SParse Matrix package) is a scientific library that provides
basic operation coverage to manipulate sparse matrices in CSC, CSR,
and IJV format.
The functionalities covered are:

 * sparse matrix -by- dense matrix products
 * sparse matrix -by- vector products
 * norm computations
 * matrix and vector scaling
 * sort functions
 * graph symmetrization and merge of duplicate entries
 * random generators for right hand sides
 * check routines for linear solvers
 * In-place format conversion routines
 * drivers to read matrices from files (MatrixMarket, Harwell-Boeing/RSA, IJV, ...)
 * Laplacian generators for stencils
 * multi-dof and variadic dof as input

Python, Julia and Fortran90 wrappers are included in the package.

*Warning*: This package do not intent to provide performance for now,
but a portable API and simple interface to manipulate sparse matrices
both in shared or distributed memory. This is somehow similar to what
has been proposed in the [GNU Sparse
Library](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/spmatrix.html) in
parallel of this project for the shared memory aspects.

## Get SPM

To use last development state of SPM, please clone the master
branch. Note that SPM contains a `git submodule` **morse_cmake**.
To get sources please use these commands:

    # if git version >= 1.9
      git clone --recursive git@gitlab.inria.fr:solverstack/spm.git
      cd spm
    # else
      git clone git@gitlab.inria.fr:solverstack/spm.git
      cd spm
      git submodule init
      git submodule update

## Documentation

The latest Doxygen documentation is available [here](http://solverstack.gitlabpages.inria.fr/spm).

The main functionalities are listed [here](http://solverstack.gitlabpages.inria.fr/spm/group__spm.html).

## Installation


### Build and install with CMake

SPM can be built using [CMake](https://cmake.org/). This
installation requires to have some library dependencies already
installed on the system:

* BLAS (MKL, OpenBlas, ...) and CBLAS (sequential version required)
* LAPACK and LAPACKE
* Python and Fortran compiler for wrappers and examples (optional)

For instance, on debian-like systems, dependencies can be installed with the following command:

      sudo apt-get install cmake gcc gfortran libopenblas-dev liblapacke-dev python-numpy

The main options to configure the SPM configuration build are:

* Classic cmake options:
  * CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE: Debug, RelWithDebInfo, Release, MinSizeRel; we recommend to use the Release, or RelWithDebInfo, for performance.
  * CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX: Specify the prefix directory to install the library
  * BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=[OFF]: Enable the shared libraries build. This option needs to be enabled for the Python wrapper.
* Integer type:
  * SPM_INT64[=ON]: Enable/disable int64_t for integer arrays.
* Documentation:
  * BUILD_DOCUMENTATION[=OFF] to enable the Doxygen documentation generation

### Reporting an issue

We strongly recommend all users to use the issue tracker to report any
